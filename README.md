## About the project

this is a sample project for a task manager application.I used angular for the front end and Node.JS for the backend. My database is MongoDB.. I created a simple taskmanager application that allows a user to create and login to their account, in their own account will be any tasks they created. Ive utilized the CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete tasks.. For the styling i primarily used bootstrapp with a little bit of css. My primary focus was to build a functional full stack task manager application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently..
